# Callback Functions
#
# When defining your plan, you have the flexibility to override the default
# behavior of Habitat in each part of the package building stage through a
# series of callbacks. To define a callback, simply create a shell function
# of the same name in your plan.sh file and then write your script. If you do
# not want to use the default callback behavior, you must override the callback
# and return 0 in the function definition.
#
# Callbacks are defined here with either their "do_default_x", if they have a
# default implementation, or empty with "return 0" if they have no default
# implementation (Bash does not allow empty function bodies.) If callbacks do
# nothing or do the same as the default implementation, they can be removed from
# this template.
#
# The default implementations (the do_default_* functions) are defined in the
# plan build script:
# https://github.com/habitat-sh/habitat/tree/master/components/plan-build/bin/hab-plan-build.sh

# There is no default implementation of this callback. You can use it to execute
# any arbitrary commands before anything else happens.
do_begin() {
  return 0
}

# The default implementation is that the software specified in $pkg_source is
# downloaded, checksum-verified, and placed in $HAB_CACHE_SRC_PATH/$pkgfilename,
# which resolves to a path like /hab/cache/src/filename.tar.gz. You should
# override this behavior if you need to change how your binary source is
# downloaded, if you are not downloading any source code at all, or if your are
# cloning from git. If you do clone a repo from git, you must override
# do_verify() to return 0.
do_download() {
  do_default_download
}

# The default implementation tries to verify the checksum specified in the plan
# against the computed checksum after downloading the source tarball to disk.
# If the specified checksum doesn't match the computed checksum, then an error
# and a message specifying the mismatch will be printed to stderr. You should
# not need to override this behavior unless your package does not download
# any files.
do_verify() {
  do_default_verify
}

# The default implementation removes the HAB_CACHE_SRC_PATH/$pkg_dirname folder
# in case there was a previously-built version of your package installed on
# disk. This ensures you start with a clean build environment.
do_clean() {
  do_default_clean
}

# The default implementation extracts your tarball source file into
# HAB_CACHE_SRC_PATH. The supported archives are: .tar, .tar.bz2, .tar.gz,
# .tar.xz, .rar, .zip, .Z, .7z. If the file archive could not be found or was
# not supported, then a message will be printed to stderr with additional
# information.

# There is no default implementation of this callback. At this point in the
# build process, the tarball source has been downloaded, unpacked, and the build
# environment variables have been set, so you can use this callback to perform
# any actions before the package starts building, such as exporting variables,
# adding symlinks, and so on.
do_prepare() {
  return 0
}

# The default implementation is to update the prefix path for the configure
# script to use $pkg_prefix and then run make to compile the downloaded source.
# This means the script in the default implementation does
# ./configure --prefix=$pkg_prefix && make. You should override this behavior
# if you have additional configuration changes to make or other software to
# build and install as part of building your package.
do_build() {
  return 0

# The default implementation runs nothing during post-compile. An example of a

# conditions must be true. A) do_check() function has been declared, B) DO_CHECK
# environment variable exists and set to true, env DO_CHECK=true.
do_check() {
  return 0
}

# The default implementation is to run make install on the source files and
# place the compiled binaries or libraries in HAB_CACHE_SRC_PATH/$pkg_dirname,
# which resolves to a path like /hab/cache/src/packagename-version/. It uses
# this location because of do_build() using the --prefix option when calling the
# configure script. You should override this behavior if you need to perform
# custom installation steps, such as copying files from HAB_CACHE_SRC_PATH to
# specific directories in your package, or installing pre-built binaries into
# your package.

  # do_default_install
}

# The default implementation is to strip any binaries in $pkg_prefix of their

# how the binaries are stripped, which additional binaries located in
# subdirectories might also need to be stripped, or whether you do not want the
# binaries stripped at all.
